                    Using Python, Pandas, Numpy, sklearn, and various data analytics skills, we found the TAM, SAM, SOM, and to create a data pipeline for future usage. We were responsible for collecting data, cleaning the data, and EDA (exploratory data analysis) before bring on 2 more engineers to help build the models.

            I worked to developed an MVP in only 9 weeks and helped earn Seed Funding (100k for 10% equity). In addition, I spearheaded a team of 6 IOS developers inorder to work towards a final product.
            Some of the tools I worked with includes Swift's Core Data, Media Player, as well as Firebase to create an Auth system, message sending (image, audio, and video sending) using Firebase, and various features more unique to the app.
            Finally, I delivered the MVP to the App Store and participated in the management of product testing and feedback.
